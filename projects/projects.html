			<p>The Kids Hack Day Club in Stockholm was an experiment in creating an open and free environment for children to learn about hacking stuff and using new tools. It was a very transformative experience which later developed into an interest for Self-Directed Education.
			</p>
			<p>The open environment contained several stations that all occupied different tools and materials, and children could choose at which station they wanted to spend their time. The stations included topics such as programming, electronics and 3D-printing. During the summer of 2014, Kids Hack Day Stockholm also organized a one-week camp called Summer Hack Camp 2014.

			<p>The Game Development majors at the University of Skövde have a 10-week course that bring together around 15 students to create a 3D game. I really enjoyed this course and learning how to collaborate across disciplines, translating the needs and requirements between programmers, artists and designers.
			</p>
			<p>We submitted Build ‘n’ Break to the Swedish Game Awards 2012, the biggest student game development competition in Sweden, and won Gamers’ Choice while being nominated for Game of the Year.

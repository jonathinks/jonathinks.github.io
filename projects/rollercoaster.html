			<p>My friend Jaguar and I had the chance to host an after-school activity at the International School of Beijing. We wanted to challenge the assumptions around education, experiment with the role of the teacher, and see how far students can push their comfort zone. To give you some background, most students in the school have never used power tools. We thought it was time for the students to leave the books behind for a while and to get their hands dirty. That's how the Incredible Super Build Project was born. The simple idea to let the students build something big that none believe they could, including themselves.
			</p>
			<p>We met with the first group of students to decide what we were going to build. Ideas floated around the room such as building a tank or a wooden structure with the sole purpose of burning it down. However, as it became known that Jaguar had built a roller coaster while studying at MIT in 2014, it was clear the students wanted their own version inside ISB.

			<p>The Kids Hack Day Club in Stockholm was an experiment in creating an open and free environment for children to learn about hacking stuff and using new tools. It was a very transformative experience which later developed into an interest for Self-Directed Education. The open environment contained several stations that all occupied different tools and materials, and children could choose at which station they wanted to spend their time. The stations included topics such as programming, electronics and 3D-printing. During the summer of 2014, Kids Hack Day Stockholm also organized a one-week camp called Summer Hack Camp 2014.

			<p><a href="http://www.kidshackday.com" target="_blank">Kids Hack Day</a> is a global series of free creative tech events for kids. We give kids tools to express their creativity, be curious and empathetic towards each other and the world around them. Kids Hack Day Club in Stockholm grew out of the massive interest after the one-day Kids Hack Day hackathon into a non-profit organization. Kids Hack Day Club was a bi-weekly hacker club were children could come together to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/KidsHackDay/photos/?tab=album&album_id=762804860397273" target="_blank">work on projects and learn about new tools</a>.
			</p>
			<p>As the Program Coordinator, I was responsible for developing content, communication, event management, outreach, recruitment, budgeting and grant applications. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNFk2JbAKZc" target="_blank">content we developed</a> include programming Python in Minecraft Pi, creating 3D models, 3D printing Minecraft models, Strawbees, Arduino robots, soldering LED wearables and building interactive MaKey MaKey projects. We developed content that was relevant to the children, meeting them half-way by preparing projects that combine technology with their interests.
			</p>
			<p>As the interest grew for the club, we managed to secure funding for the 2014-2015 school year and organize a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/KidsHackDay/photos/?tab=album&album_id=823522000992225" target="_blank">one-week Summer Hack Camp</a> in the summer of 2014 where we took the concept one step further. After working on projects for a week, we went to Tom Tits Experiments in Södertälje to hold an exhibition of the projects that the children created.

			<p>Build 'n' Break is a project developed from scratch by 17 game development students. We participated in the Swedish Game Awards 2012
			and won Gamers' Choice and was nominated for Game of the Year. As a result, we were invited to visit <a href="https://www.wooga.com/" target="_blank">Wooga</a> in Berlin
			where I would later end up writing my Bachelor thesis.
			</p>
			<p>Build 'n' Break is a two-player "just hanging out on the couch" kind of game, bringing back the feeling we had of playing games growing up.
			As the game begins, the two players will simultaneously build their own tower using a randomized mix of blocks. As the tower is becoming finished,
			the player needs to put up to three cannons at strategic locations on their tower(s). The high up the cannon is placed, the more force it can shoot with,
			thus incentivizing the player to build more exciting structures. The game is won as you shoot down all of your opponents cannons, making the cannon both the players offense and defense.</p>
			<p>After a fixed amount of time, the game moves to the second phase: the Attack Phase. Here, the game becomes turn-based as the two players take turns to shoot
			down their opponents cannons. When aiming, the player need to take into account the wind blowing sideways as well as the angle to adjust how high the cannon ball will fly.
			</p>
			My role in the project was to plan and coordinate the development of the project while making sure the communication between disciplines such as software development
			and the creation of graphical assets was smooth and without missunderstandings. In addition, I programmed early prototypes for game mechanics and later moved on to focus
			on optimizing the performance for the Xbox 360 hardware.

			<h3>Hallå! 你好！</h3>
			<p>I'm <b>Jonathan Nylander</b>, a Swedish technologist, educator and activist currently based in Beijing.</p>
			<p>What is your favorite piece of art? Mine is <a href="https://julianoliver.com/output/harvest" target="_blank">HARVEST by Julian Oliver</a>, a project using wind energy to mine cryptocurrency to fund climate research. I love the juxtaposition between the clear pracicality in a world in need of climate research, and the revolutionary ideas of non-human autonomous actors enabled by the cryptoeconomic space, particularly smart contracts.<p>
			<p>My formal education is a mix of <a href="projects/buildnbreak.html">Computer Science</a>, Mandarin Chinese and Sustainable Development (link to 30dc). What I am trying to say is that I enjoy working across disciplines.<p>
			<p>I have taught quite a bit in schools, but after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holt_(educator)" target="_blank">John Holt</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/703532.Mindstorms" target="_blank">Seymour Papert</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15843125-free-to-learn" target="_blank">Peter Gray</a>, I decided to quit the traditional teaching profession. I believe that children are people who, like adults, can be trusted to make decisions about their own lives, which is why I advocate and design for <a href="http://self-directed.org/" target="_blank">Self-Directed Education</a>.</p>
			<p>I believe climate change is one of the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_justice" target="_blank">unjust and wicked problems</a> of our time. I am always trying out new ways of communicating the issue, as you can see among my <a href="projects/projects.html">projects</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want to know more about what I am thinking and doing, check out my <a href="https://medium.com/@jonathinks" target="_blank">thoughts on Medium</a> and <a href="projects/projects.html">projects</a> I have been working on. If you would like to hang out or work together, please don't hesitate to shoot me an <a href="mailto:jontemails@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanylander" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
